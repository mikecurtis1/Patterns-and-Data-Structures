        The following samples render various XML documents in the browser using XSL and CSS. The 
        source code for each can be viewed through my GitHub 
        <a href="https://github.com/mikecurtis1/democode/tree/gh-pages">democode</a> repository.

            <blockquote>
            This is one of my favorite Shakespeare sonnets. And what better demonstration of a 
            document type definition (DTD) than a sonnet? A sonnet isn't just a poem. A sonnet has a 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnet#English_.28Shakespearean.29_sonnet">well defined structure with formal names</a> for its parts: quatraine, couplet, rhyme scheme etc. I 
            expressed these formal elements in my <a href="DTD/sonnet/sonnet29.dtd">DTD</a> (view source code) 
            and in XML attributes.

            <blockquote>
            A film description offers an interesting example for a formal document definition. Not 
            only can a film be described with rich metadata, but that data is often context-specific. 
            For example: dates. A date associated with a film can describe both when the film was 
            produced and also the date of the setting. Or consider awards. Awards can be give to the film - ex. 
            National Film Registry - or to indivual cast and crew members - ex. best cinematography. 
            In this example the definition includes many optional and implied parts and the XLT 
            transformation helps handle the labeling and punctuation of this optional content.

            format. <a href="https://www.loc.gov/marc/">MaRC</a> is the standard metadata format for 
            library catalog records and was developed by the Library of Congress. The MaRC metadata 
            schema is very granular and identifies fields 
            with alpha-numeric codes. This document is styled so that the data column has an approximately 
            50 character measure for readability.</blockquote>

            <blockquote>
            The XML of this sample is the direct output of a report from Aleph - a popular 
            library catalog system. Often these reports are tweaked and opened in MS Excel. But, in 
            this case I created an XSL transformation to work directly on the unmodified report and 
            prepare it for viewing. Ranking the books  was accomplished in XSL, because it could not 
            be accomplished in the Aleph report. Cover images come from the Google Books API based 
            on ISBN's found in the report data.

            Metadata Encode and Transmission Standard (<a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/">METS</a>) 
            is a standard maintained by the Library of Congress 
            and is commonly used in digital libraries and archives. METS documents use their own 
            namespace and encode some metadata with other schemata such as MODS and Dublin Core. This 
            sample simply lists each datum with its element name and any relevant modifier attributes.
